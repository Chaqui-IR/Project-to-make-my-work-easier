# Project-to-make-my-work-easier
This project I am working on will hopefully help me not have to work so much...
It is still in developement, but what it should do is take a word document with {preSelected} tags, using docxHandler.
Use an image reader in my case ocrHandler, and populate the areas by the {preSelected} tags, 
in hinesight, this project is taking me longer than what it would take me to do the job by hand,
but I am hopping this will help the rest of my team as well.

I am currently having issues showing the preview, and I am unable to choose the save file path,
I think I have everything set up as it should, but sadly it is not working as intended.
